it seems like the human CoM deviates by 10cm during walking, our task is somewhat analogous to estimating the CoM of a person that is carrying the device

in a healthy gait (walking only), we always have the two feet at symmetrical distance, so their average would give us the closest projection of the human to the ground while walking

this can be improved later on, but it seems like the following would work up to approx 10cm of error:
- the walker should walk with arms by the side (or holding the laptop / phone etc.)
- if the two feet are visible we should take their average as the position
- if the two feet arent visible, we take the bottom midpoint of the BB as the position
