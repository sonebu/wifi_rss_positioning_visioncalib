	Arduino-Based Location Tracking 

1-)Indoor Positioning Using WIFI (RSSI) and Machine Learning
This method applies the fingerprint method using machine learning.
It does not have high sensitivity values. However, in large areas with
more than one room, it can detect which room it is in.
It uses SVM Classifier as the machine learning algorithm.

2-)Indoor Positioning Using WIFI (RSSI) and Machine Learning v.2
This method is the same with first one but it uses Classifier ML model.

3-)Indoor positioning system using visible light communication and ultrasound
This method is employe Visible Light Communication to determine the location
Since we do not want to use any other complicated system, we will not use it.

4-)Indoor Ultra-wide Band (UWB) Positioning 
This method uses UWB radio frequency signals to localization. It requires
some UWB transmitter and receivers. It is costly.
