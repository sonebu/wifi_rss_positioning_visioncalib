before starting wireshark, turn your wifi off, then run the following:
		sudo iw phy phy0 interface add mon0 type monitor
		sudo ip link set mon0 up

at this point the card is in monitoring mode. If you're going to do channel hopping, first install the chanhop.sh script:
	https://web.archive.org/web/20070301073636if_/http://802.11ninja.net:80/code/chanhop.sh

then make it executable with:
	sudo chmod 700 chanhop.sh

afterwards, while your card is in monitor mode, run the chanhop.sh script as follows:
	sudo ./chanhop.sh -i mon0 -b IEEE80211B -b IEEE80211A -d .25

	this makes your wifi card hop over the list of all available 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels with 250ms waiting intervals.

now start wireshark while the channel hopper runs on a separate terminal, and capture the interface named mon0.
the main idea is for the wireshark capture tool to catch all messages from channels in 250ms intervals. 
there are a lot of channels and packets run very fast though, so this method is bound to miss a lot of packets.

About the channel hopper script:

	direct link to file --> https://web.archive.org/web/20070301073636if_/http://802.11ninja.net:80/code/chanhop.sh

	this seems to be the origin of the script:

	but I don't think this japanese person is the original writer (see comment at the top of the script)
