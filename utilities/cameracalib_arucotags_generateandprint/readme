To generate Aruco tags, the generate_markers.py script can be executed. When the script is run, it generates 17 Aruco tags. The dictionary to which the tag belongs is hard-coded within the script. The most suitable dictionary for our purpose has been selected, and the IDs have been chosen from 0 to 16. To use the Aruco tags in the real world, they need to be printed. The printed tags are set to have equal sizes, each being 19 centimeters. The tags can be printed using aruco.docx and aruco.pdf. If a specific tag needs to be printed, the corresponding page (tag ID + 1) can be printed.
